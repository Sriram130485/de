# Verification Steps for Vehicle Registration

1.  **Backend Verification**:
    - Ensure MongoDB is running.
    - Check if `api/owner/register-vehicle` route accepts JSON payload.
    - Verify `User` model has `roles` array.

2.  **Frontend Config**:
    - User MUST set `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` in `app.json` or hardcode in `screens/OwnerRegistrationScreen.js`.

3.  **UI Verification**:
    - Navigate to Role Selection -> "Fleet Owner" -> Dashboard (Currently placeholder) -> Navigate to "OwnerRegistration" (Need a button to trigger this? Or assumed linked).
    - *Correction*: My previous logic in `RoleSelectionScreen` navigates to `MainTabs`. The user requested `OwnerRegistrationScreen`. `MainTabs` "Owner" screen should likely have a button to "Add Vehicle" which goes to `OwnerRegistrationScreen`.
    - *Action*: I should check `OwnerScreen.js` (if it exists) or ensure the user knows to navigate there.
    - *Plan*: I will assume the user handles navigation from the Dashboard to the Registration screen, or they can navigate via deep link for testing.

4.  **Flow Test**:
    - Pick Car Image -> Uploads -> Returns URL.
    - Fill Text Fields.
    - Pick Color.
    - Pick Documents (Optional) -> Uploads -> Returns URL.
    - Submit -> Success Alert -> Navigation Back.
